#Create a class named Person with a constructor that receives the 
#parameters name, age, and city. Add a method called greet() that displays a 
#message such as: "Hi, my name is Ana, I am 25 years old, and I live in Mexico." 
#Create three objects of the Person class and make each one call the greet() 
#method.
